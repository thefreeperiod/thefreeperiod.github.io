          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <p>Our mission is to enable students to become active particpants in their education and to expand their capacity to engage with the information they receive from different sources.</p>

          <h2>Our Ideology</h2>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <p>We believe that true learning and intellectual growth takes place when children are allowed to think freely, without the overarching constrains of one-sided pedagogy, standardised teaching tools and a framework that focuses on right and wrong.</p>
          <p>In order to be independent thinkers, students must be encouraged to question, not answer - to explore, prod and examine established facts, and imagine how things could be different. Students must be encouraged to treat knowledge creatively and take liberties with it so that they can reflect on everything that they are told, instead of passively accepting it.</p>

          <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <p>1. <strong>Flexible Curriculum</strong>: By utilising a flexible curriculum that does away with textbook based teaching and responds to the interests and capcities of the students, we ensure that students do not feel detached from what they are learning.</p>
          <p>2. <strong>Egalitarian Classrooms</strong>: There is no hierearchy in our classrooms between an authoritative "teacher" and less knwoledgeable students. Instead, the mediators merely present interesting ideas that are discussed and debated by students. They try to motiavte the students to take a critical perspective on the topics being discussed and question key assumptions or established consensus.</p>
          <p>3. <strong>Active learning</strong>: The students are free to choose the theme or idea they would like to work on during the course, and the form in which they would like to present their ideas- a poem, a piece of theatre, an essay or a drawing. The only requirement is that the projects must be based on the original thoughts and interpretations of the students.</p>
