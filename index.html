          <p><strong>The Free Period</strong> is an innovative summer school for curious minds aged between 10 &amp; 14 years. It aims to develop the 21st Century skills or the “four C’s” - Critical thinking &amp; Problem Solving, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity &amp; Innovation - in the students. We want to enable students to become active particpants in their education and to expand their capacity to engage with the information they receive from different sources.</p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <p>We believe that true learning and intellectual growth takes place when children are allowed to think freely, without the overarching constrains of one-sided pedagogy, standardised teaching tools and a framework that focuses on right and wrong.</p>
          <p>In order to be independent thinkers, students must be encouraged to question, not answer - to explore, prod and examine established facts, and imagine how things could be different. Students must be encouraged to treat knowledge creatively and take liberties with it so that they can reflect on everything that they are told, instead of passively accepting it.</p>
